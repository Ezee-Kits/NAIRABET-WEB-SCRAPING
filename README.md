# Nairabet Web Scraping

The **Nairabet Web Scraping** script is designed to scrape upcoming football match data from the Nairabet website. The script extracts match details such as the match time, teams, and betting odds (home, draw, away) and saves them in a CSV file for further analysis or integration into betting strategies.

## üìå Features

- **Automated Data Scraping**: Collects football match data and odds from the Nairabet site.
- **CSV Output**: Organizes and stores the scraped data in a CSV file for easy access.
- **Duplicate and Exception Handling**: Ensures data is clean by removing rows with invalid odds and handling potential duplicates.
- **Dynamic Page Loading**: Automatically clicks the "View More" button to load additional matches.

## üöÄ How It Works

1. **Initialization**: A headless browser session is created using Selenium, and the script navigates to the Nairabet football page.
2. **Page Interaction**: The script interacts with the "View More" button multiple times to load additional matches from the site.
3. **Data Scraping**: Extracts match details (time, home and away teams, and odds for each match).
4. **CSV Storage**: Stores the collected data in a CSV file at a specified path.
5. **Data Cleaning**: Invalid rows (with non-numeric odds) are automatically removed from the CSV file.

### Key Components:

- **Selenium**: Used to automate interactions with the Nairabet website, including clicking and scrolling.
- **BeautifulSoup**: Extracts match information from the page's HTML content.
- **CSV File Management**: Manages saving the match data into CSV files and ensuring data integrity through duplicate removal and exception handling.

   ```

4. **View Results**:
